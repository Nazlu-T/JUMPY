# JUMPY
A Unity-powered 2D platformer inspired by the classic Doodle Jump. This project highlights my ability to design scalable systems and craft interactive mechanics using Unity and C#.

Key Features:
Dynamic Platform System:

Developed diverse platform behaviors, including moving and breaking platforms, to keep gameplay fresh and challenging.
Implemented a dynamic spawning system tailored for a 16:9 portrait layout, creating an endless progression experience.

Player Progression and Feedback:
Built a session-based score system that tracks upward movement, rewarding players for their progress.
Designed a high-score feature with real-time updates and celebratory feedback for new achievements.

Interactive Coin Collection and Currency System:
Created a rewarding coin collection mechanic with randomly spawning coins on platforms.
Designed a persistent currency system, enabling players to save coins across sessions and spend them on customizations like new characters and backgrounds.

Customizable and Responsive UI:
Centralized UI management through a GameSharedUI system using the singleton pattern for simplicity and safety.
Developed specialized shopping interfaces for characters and backgrounds, enhancing player engagement.

Shop System Using ScriptableObjects and Database:
Implemented a robust shop system leveraging ScriptableObjects to store data for characters and backgrounds.
Designed a database structure to manage shop items efficiently, enabling easy updates and scalability for future additions.

Immersive Visuals with Dynamic Backgrounds:
Implemented a BackGroundChange system, allowing seamless customization of game scene aesthetics.

Technical and Professional Highlights:
Code Excellence: Focused on clean, modular, and maintainable C# scripting to ensure scalability and ease of future updates.
Cross-Platform Optimization: Designed input systems and UI interactions with cross-platform compatibility in mind.
Problem-Solving and Testing: Leveraged test-time solutions to manage and reset game data effectively during development.
